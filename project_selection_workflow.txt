Interactive Project Selection Workflow:

This document outlines the steps I would follow using the available tools to allow the user to select a project directory to work within, starting from the current working directory.

1.  **Initial Directory Listing:**
    -   Use the `list_files` tool with the path "." to list the contents of the current directory.
    -   Present the list of files and directories to the user.

2.  **Prompt for Project Selection/Navigation:**
    -   Ask the user to specify which directory they want to work in.
    -   Provide options:
        -   Select a subdirectory listed.
        -   Go up to the parent directory using "..".
        -   Confirm the current directory "." if it appears to be a project root.

3.  **Process User Input:**
    -   Read the user's input.

4.  **Navigate and List New Directory:**
    -   Based on the user's input (subdirectory name, ".", or ".."), update the current working path internally.
    -   Use the `list_files` tool with the new path to list its contents.
    -   Present the new list of files and directories to the user.

5.  **Analyze Directory Contents (Heuristic):**
    -   Examine the listed files and directories for common project indicators (e.g., `package.json`, `Gemfile`, `pom.xml`, `setup.py`, `Dockerfile`, `src/`, `test/`, build scripts).
    -   Based on the analysis, attempt to determine if the current directory:
        -   Looks like the root of a single project.
        -   Looks like a directory containing multiple sub-projects (e.g., many subdirectories each with project indicators).
        -   Is just a regular directory.

6.  **Clarification/Confirmation (if necessary):**
    -   If the analysis is ambiguous or suggests a directory of multiple projects, ask the user for clarification:
        -   Confirm if this is the correct project root.
        -   If it appears to contain multiple projects, ask the user to select a specific sub-project directory from the list.

7.  **Set Working Context:**
    -   Once a single project directory is confirmed, all subsequent file operations (`read_file`, `edit_file`) and shell commands (`run_shell_command`) will be interpreted relative to this selected project path.

8.  **Looping:**
    -   Steps 4-6 can be repeated, allowing the user to navigate up or down the directory tree until the desired project directory is located and confirmed.

This interactive process, managed through dialogue and repeated tool calls, allows navigation and selection without modifying the core application's startup logic.
