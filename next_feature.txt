This project is a programming agent but the tools (src/tools) are a bit basic, a bit crusty and couls generally do with an expert eye! I've made a utils folder (src/utils) can you write a utility for logging that adds some terminal colours, can you add a tool for searching for keywords in a project, a tool for adding folders, a tool for deleting files, and any other tools that you think might be handy?

One thing I would say, the run_shell_command tool exists to run dangerous commands with user permission at each step. I suggest this tool might use grep and find in a safe and pleasant manner. Same with the directory creation tool, it's a safe command and needs its own tool. File removal may be a little less safe, but we could implement a recycle bin pattern to allow the tool to refactor effectively. Please build these as tools.


Okay, I've created the logging utility in `src/utils/logger.rb` for you. You can now import and use the `Logger` class for colored terminal output.

For the keyword searching functionality across the project, this is a more involved task. It would require listing all files, reading their content, and searching within each one. I propose we implement this as a distinct feature.

**Feature 1: Project Keyword Search Tool**

This tool will allow you to search for a specific keyword or pattern within the content of all files in the project, or a specified subdirectory.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Receive a list of concepts you want to search for.
2.  Use ruby backticks to call system tools (this may be a pattern we want to consider as part of utils - logging the command use, running the command, logging the response length and returning the result as JSON)
3.  Report file paths that may be relevant, and line numbers where matches are found.
4. Order by some metric of relevance, and ensure the output is nor too long

This tool would be very useful for navigating and understanding the codebase.

Further considerations:

a. Paginated results - as a pattern, this may need some thinking. I can help develop a cogent strategy that will work across different tools
b. Indexing and code grouping categories. Maybe beyond the scope, but imagine the power of saying "in the payment system" and knowing all the views, models, controllers and utilities instantly.

For now, let's take a YAGNI approach and iterate!


Feature 2: the directory creation tool logic.

**Logic for "Create Directory" Tool:**

*   **Inputs:** `path` (string) - the path for the new directory.
*   **Action:** Execute `mkdir -p <path>` using utilities`. The `-p` flag is important as it creates parent directories if they don't exist and doesn't throw an error if the directory already exists, making it quite safe.
*   **Output:** Confirm the directory was created or already exists.


Once these are done, let's think up more useful features!
